# VT100-Terminal-on-Bare-Metal-Pi-Zero
This is a bare metal implementation of a VT100 terminal based on the work of Filippo Bergamasco (https://github.com/fbergama/pigfx). I modified the original code to accommodate my requirements to build a VT100 replica in 60% size based on the 3D model provided by Megardi (https://www.instructables.com/23-Scale-VT100-Terminal-Reproduction/).
